## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

I'd like to build an iOS app that helps people track both medications and supplements—especially those managing chronic health conditions who often take a mix of both. The app would include features like daily reminders with AM/PM timing, low supply notifications, and a monthly refill checklist with checkboxes for each item. Users could log when they started a supplement, track how consistently they've taken it, and see a history of past doses. Another key feature would be a customizable "Favorites" section, where users can save trusted products with details like brand, dosage, count, and links to reorder. The goal is to make health management more organized and less stressful.
